MOC: [[LA14 L7 Class and Ethnicity]]

---

At first, social **classes were based on the type of work** : manual, non-manual, manager, small employers, semi-routine occupations (shop assistants, etc.)

---

Middle class is rising
**Working class is declining**
=> Obviously because of the change of society & economy : manual jobs aren't really manual anymore


>Rapid rise of the middle class paralleled by the inexorable decline of the traditional working class (between 7 and 14 per cent according to various studies), which no longer appears as such in official social classifications

> It was clearly the changes in the structure of the economy (decline of the manufacturing industry and expansion of the service sector) that ultimately reshaped the social structure of society.

Yet
>more Britons consider themselves ‘working class’ (about 35 per cent) than the actual number of people employed in manual jobs (25 per cent)

People know to spot other's classes
>A YouGov survey published in 2010 revealed that 71 per cent of people had no difficulty figuring out other people’s class, while only a minority of respondents (5 per cent) could not say which social class they belonged to.

> YouGov survey (2019) has shown that 44 per cent say they are middle class (upper middle: 3 per cent; middle-middle: 27; lower middle 14 per cent). By contrast, a similar proportion of respondents (43 per cent) categorize themselves as working class (working class 31 per cent; upper working class 12 per cent) whereas barely a quarter of the active population hold manual jobs.

> Zero per cent of respondents say they are upper class (as against 1 per cent in 1949) which could of course suggest that, as a category, the upper class has become irrelevant

=> but denying being upper-class is typical from the upper-class & sound arrogant in today's Britain

# Press
> As far as the press is concerned, the emergence of so called ‘mid-market’ papers such as the Daily Mail, which attract as many working class as middle class readers have also contributed to the blurring of class boundaries (a mid-market paper could be loosely defined as a hybrid between a down-market tabloid and a quality paper). In the same way some traditionally ‘serious’ newspapers like The Times have in the last decades gone through a **process of ‘tabloidization’** (smaller format, abundant use of colour, eye-catching headlines, lighter topics, etc.)

# Social mobility

- 77% : class gap is "very wide"
- 44% : class depends solely on parent's background
- 39% : climbing is harder than in the past
- vs. 22% it is easier
> The Social Mobility Barometer published by the Social Mobility Commission for 2019-2020 has thus revealed that a significant 77 per cent of British people believe that the gap between social classes remains very wide, while 44 per cent consider that an individual’s place in society depends solely on their parents’ social background. As far as social mobility itself is concerned, 39 per cent think that climbing the social ladder is more difficult than in the past, while less than one quarter (22 per cent) believe it is now easier (29 per cent think things have not changed).


Wealth depends on Education
> wealth in the UK is more closely correlated with academic achievement than in other OECD countries, children from deprived backgrounds being ‘trapped’ in the lowest-performing state schools where preparation for higher education is often inadequate
