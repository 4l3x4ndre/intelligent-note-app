# How media differ from other products and services

Benefits are measured by
- money
- non-economic benefits
	- social
	- cultural
	- political

## Differences: Basic Level
?
- creative/artistic work
- more visible from the public: day-to-day life & celebrity are more attractive
- benefits from copyrights & related rights
- interdependencies (influences): public policy regulation <-> media

## Differences: Supply-Side 
?
- less direct competition
- many people create without compensation
- Products are created through
	- an artistic process (unpredictable)
	- employees that are autonomous: different goals than content-creators or managers
- non-physical products have specific distribution mechanisms and costs
- piracy

## Differences: Demand-Side
?
- success depends on the consumer (unpredictable)
- multiple reuses
- many products -> consumers have the market power
- small number of services generate a great portion of the economic value of media products
- consumed more often as the consumption is higher

## Punchline

Differences of:
- financial & operational characteristics
- challenges for manager in the business dynamics
- understandability from a media type to another = long learning curve (difficult to change)

# The Role of Profit and Return

## Profits
?
Profits = income - expenses
Functions:
- finance improvements (equipment; facilities)
- experiment new methods & products & services
- pay investors.

## Concept of return
?
**[[Concept of return]]** = indicator of profitability 
- efficiency of internal operations
	- how well is doing the firm in terms of
		- holding down the costs of resources
		- increasing revenue from sales

## Risk Theory of Profit
?
- To attract investors, companies must have a returns above average, thus profitable for investors.
- Return surge rapidly (innovation) then fade (imitation from other companies).
